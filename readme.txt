#Very basic Spring-MVC Blog App with Spring Boot and Gradle

This is an incredibly basic blog app I created with Spring MVC.

The purpose for building this was to familiarise myself with the SPring MVC framework and Gradle.

It uses Thymeleaf for templating and a simple in memory Java ArrayList database.

It is not particularly advanced and doesn't look like much but it was created as a learning exercise.
